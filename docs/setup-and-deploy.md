# Setup and deployment

Two parts: **wire up Supabase** so sign-in works, then **ship to the App
Store**. Do them in that order — you cannot test a build you cannot sign into.

## The short version

Fifteen minutes if nothing fights you. Every step is expanded below.

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. **SQL Editor** → paste `supabase/schema.sql` → **Run**.
3. **Project Settings → API** → copy the Project URL and the **publishable**
   key (or the older **anon** key) into `.env` (`cp .env.example .env` first).
4. Run `npm run auth:urls` and paste what it prints into **Authentication →
   URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**. It computes them from `app.json` and
   your LAN address, which is where the mistakes otherwise happen.
5. **Authentication → Providers → Email** → on. That is enough to sign in.
   Google and Microsoft each need an account with that provider and take
   about ten minutes apiece; they are steps 5 and 6.
6. `npx expo start --clear`, sign up with an email, and check a row appeared
   in **Table Editor → profiles**.

Steps 1–3 and 5 are the minimum to get a working login. OAuth can wait.

> **You do not need to send me your keys.** The anon key is safe to ship
> inside the app, but nothing about setting it up requires sharing it — the
> app reads it from your `.env`, which is git-ignored.

# Part 1 — Supabase

## 1. Create the project

1. <https://supabase.com/dashboard> → **New project**.
2. Pick a region physically near your users; it sets your latency floor.
3. Save the database password somewhere real. You cannot recover it later.

## 2. Run the schema

**SQL Editor → New query**, paste all of [`supabase/schema.sql`](../supabase/schema.sql), **Run**.

That creates the `profiles` table, the row-level-security policies, and a
trigger that makes a row whenever someone signs up. It is safe to run twice —
every column added since the first release is written as `add column if not
exists`, so re-running it after pulling is how you pick those up rather than
something to avoid.

> **Do not skip the RLS part.** The app ships with your anon key inside it —
> anyone who downloads the app has it. RLS is the only thing stopping one
> student reading another's row. Verify it took: **Table Editor → profiles →**
> the shield icon should read **RLS enabled**.

## 3. Get your keys

**Project Settings → API**. Copy:

- **Project URL** → `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_...`) → `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Older projects show an **anon / public** key instead. Either works and goes in
the same variable, which keeps its original name so existing `.env` files do
not break.

Prefer the publishable key where you have the choice. The legacy `anon` and
`service_role` keys are JWTs signed with the project's JWT secret, so rotating
a leaked one means rotating that secret — which invalidates every key and signs
out every user at once. Publishable and secret keys are independent credentials
you can revoke and roll one at a time.

Create `.env` in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and paste both in. `.env` is git-ignored.

> **Never put the secret key in the app** — `sb_secret_...`, or `service_role`
> on older projects. `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables are inlined into the JS bundle at
> build time, so anyone who unpacked the IPA would read it, and it bypasses RLS
> completely: full read/write on every student's data.
>
> The publishable key in the same file is fine there. It is meant to be public,
> and the RLS policies — not the key's secrecy — are what protect the rows.

## 4. Set the redirect URLs

Run this first — it computes every URL from `app.json` and this machine's own
LAN address, so there is nothing to guess at:

```bash
npm run auth:urls
```

**Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs.** Add what it prints:

```
studyplat://auth/callback
exp://<your-lan-ip>:8081/--/auth/callback
exp://**
https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

The first is the production app (it matches `scheme` in `app.json`). The middle
two are Expo Go during development — the wildcard saves you re-editing this
every time your laptop changes network. The last is Supabase's own callback,
which the providers below need.

**A mismatch here is the single most common reason sign-in fails**, and the
symptom is unhelpful: the browser sheet opens, you log in, and it either hangs
or returns you to a signed-out app.

## 5. Enable email and password

**Authentication → Providers → Email** → on.

This is the one that needs no third-party account, works in the simulator, and
is the only way to test sign-in before Google and Microsoft are registered. The
app has had email sign-up and sign-in on the login screen since the OAuth work
landed.

One setting matters: **Confirm email**.

- **On** (Supabase's default) — a new account gets a confirmation link by email
  and cannot sign in until it is clicked. The app handles this: sign-up returns
  "Account created. Check your email to confirm it, then sign in."
- **Off** — sign-up signs you straight in. Much faster while developing.

Supabase's built-in mailer is rate-limited to a handful of messages an hour and
is not meant for production. Turn confirmation **off** while you build, and
before you ship either turn it back on with your own SMTP configured under
**Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings**, or leave it off
deliberately.

## 6. Enable Google

1. <https://console.cloud.google.com> → new project.
2. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** → External → fill in app name,
   support email, developer email. Add scopes `email` and `profile`.
3. **Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application.**
4. Under **Authorised redirect URIs** add exactly:
   `https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
6. Back in Supabase: **Authentication → Providers → Google** → enable → paste
   both → Save.

> While the consent screen is in **Testing**, only accounts you list under
> *Test users* can sign in. Publish it before you submit to Apple, or the
> reviewer will be locked out and reject the build.

## 7. Enable Microsoft (Azure)

1. <https://portal.azure.com> → **Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations → New
   registration**.
2. Under **Supported account types** choose
   **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**
   — otherwise personal @outlook.com accounts cannot sign in.
3. **Redirect URI**: platform **Web**, value
   `https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
4. Copy the **Application (client) ID**.
5. **Certificates & secrets → New client secret** → copy the **Value**
   immediately; it is only shown once.
6. In Supabase: **Authentication → Providers → Azure** → enable → paste the
   client ID and secret. Leave **Azure Tenant URL** blank for multi-tenant.

## 8. Test it

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Open on a device or simulator. Both buttons should open a browser sheet, and
after logging in the sheet should close itself and land you on the intro.

Check it worked: **Supabase → Table Editor → profiles** should now have a row
whose `id` matches **Authentication → Users**.

### If it fails

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| "That sign-in method is not switched on" | The provider is disabled in Supabase. |
| "The redirect URL is not on the allow-list" | Step 4 — the URL must match character for character. |
| Sheet opens, logs in, returns signed out | Redirect URL mismatch, or `scheme` in `app.json` does not match. |
| "This build has no Supabase keys yet" | `.env` missing, or you did not restart with `--clear`. |
| Works in Expo Go, fails in a real build | You added the `exp://` URL but not `studyplat://`. |
| Signed in, but the app shows "Not syncing" | The write is failing. Usually the deployed schema is behind — re-run `supabase/schema.sql`. |
| Sign-up says to check your email, nothing arrives | Supabase's built-in mailer is rate-limited. Turn **Confirm email** off while developing (step 5). |

# Part 2 — Shipping to the App Store

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Apple Developer Program membership** — $99/year, and enrolment can take a
  day or two. Start this first; it is the longest lead time in the process.
- A Mac is *not* required. EAS builds in the cloud.

## 2. Set up EAS

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure
```

That writes `eas.json` and fills in the `extra.eas.projectId` field that is
currently blank in `app.json`.

## 3. Give EAS your secrets

`.env` is not uploaded with your build. Push the two keys to EAS instead:

```bash
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL --value "https://your-ref.supabase.co"
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value "your-anon-key"
```

## 4. Build

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

EAS will offer to generate signing credentials — let it. First build takes
15–30 minutes.

## 5. Submit

```bash
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

## 6. App Store Connect

At <https://appstoreconnect.apple.com>, create the app record and fill in:

**Required before you can submit**

- **Screenshots** — 6.7" iPhone is mandatory. The map, a question, and the
  progress screen make the strongest three.
- **Description, keywords, support URL, marketing URL.**
- **Age rating** — answer the questionnaire honestly; this app should land at
  4+.
- **Privacy policy URL** — *mandatory*, and you cannot submit without a real,
  reachable page. It must state that you collect email address and name via
  Google/Microsoft sign-in, and that progress data is stored on Supabase.

**Privacy nutrition labels.** Declare truthfully:

| Data | Collected | Linked to user | Used for tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email address | Yes | Yes | No |
| Name | Yes | Yes | No |
| User ID | Yes | Yes | No |
| Product interaction (progress, XP) | Yes | Yes | No |

**Export compliance.** `app.json` already sets
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false`, which is correct — you use HTTPS only,
which is exempt. This saves you a form on every submission.

## 7. What Apple will most likely reject you for

These are the ones that actually bite apps like this one:

1. **Guideline 5.1.1(v) — Account sign-in.** If an app offers third-party
   sign-in, Apple usually requires **Sign in with Apple** alongside it. With
   Google and Microsoft and nothing else, expect a rejection. Supabase supports
   Apple as a provider; budget for adding it before you submit.
2. **Guideline 5.1.1(ii) — Data collection.** You must offer **account
   deletion** from inside the app, not just a support email. A "Delete my
   account" control under Profile that calls a Supabase edge function is the
   usual answer.
3. **Reviewer cannot sign in.** If your Google consent screen is still in
   Testing, or Azure is single-tenant, review fails immediately. Also provide a
   **demo account** in App Review notes — reviewers frequently cannot complete
   OAuth on their test devices.
4. **Broken links.** Support URL and privacy policy URL must both load.
   These live in `site/` and are served by GitHub Pages — see below. Preview
   them locally with the `studyplat-site` launch config.

## Publishing the public pages

App Store Connect requires a working **privacy policy URL** and **support
URL**; both are checked, and a dead one is a straightforward rejection. Four
static pages cover it, in `site/`:

| Page | Used for |
|---|---|
| `privacy.html` | App Store Connect privacy policy URL, Google consent screen |
| `support.html` | App Store Connect support URL |
| `terms.html` | Linked from the sign-in screen |
| `index.html` | Optional marketing URL |

To publish them free from this repo: **GitHub → Settings → Pages → Source:
Deploy from a branch → Branch `main`, folder `/site` → Save.** They appear at
`https://aarushkik.github.io/StudyPlat/` within a minute or two.

If GitHub only offers `/` and `/docs` as folders, either move `site/` to
`docs/` or use a Pages action; the URLs in `src/lib/links.ts` are the only
thing that has to change with it.

> **Read both pages before you submit.** They are written from what the app
> actually does — the columns it stores, the fact that there is no analytics or
> advertising, and that deletion is in-app — but the contact address and the
> claims are yours to stand behind. This is a starting point drafted against
> the code, not legal advice.

## 8. Recommended order

1. Add **Sign in with Apple** (see rejection risk 1).
2. Add **account deletion** (risk 2).
3. Write the privacy policy and host it.
4. Publish the Google consent screen.
5. Build, submit, and put a demo account in the review notes.

## Still outstanding in the app itself

Honest list of what is not finished, so nothing surprises you at review time:

- **Sign in with Apple is not built.** Guideline 5.1.1(v) requires it wherever
  an app offers third-party sign-in, and Google plus Microsoft without it is a
  near-certain rejection. `AuthProvider` already carries the case and the flow
  is provider-agnostic, so it is a button here and a provider in Supabase — but
  it cannot be configured or tested without an Apple Developer membership, so
  it waits on that.
- **Boss sprites** are specced in
  [`character-sprite-prompts.md`](./character-sprite-prompts.md) but not
  generated, so all sixty fights show a crest rather than a character.
  Companion sprites are specced too, but each companion carries a prop sprite
  chosen for its ability, which reads well enough to ship.
- **Track backdrops are procedural.** Silhouettes and seeded arcs rather than
  drawn art; specced in [`background-prompts.md`](./background-prompts.md).
  Fine to ship, and the weakest-looking part of the map.
- **Question banks are 120 per course**, twelve per unit. Enough that a track
  does not feel thin, not enough that a single track never repeats an item —
  around thirty per unit is where that stops being noticeable.
- **The session screens from the design** (Summary, LevelUp, BossIntro,
  BossFight, Victory, Defeat, WorldDone, Streak) are not built. Sessions end on
  `LessonComplete`, which covers the same ground with one screen instead of
  eight.

Done since the last pass: account deletion, companion abilities, per-course
weak spots, derived achievements, and the endless review at the foot of each
cleared track.
