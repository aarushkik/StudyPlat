# Character & boss sprites — generation prompts

Eighteen sprites: **twelve companions** for the Characters screen and the
Profile preview, and **six bosses**, one per boss rank.

Save as transparent PNG into `src/assets/characters/` with the exact filenames
below. Square, 1024×1024. They get trimmed, bottom-aligned and downscaled to
512 on the way in, the same pipeline the props use.

## Master style block

Paste this **before** every subject line. It is what keeps eighteen separately
generated characters looking like one cast — and like they belong beside the
platypus.

> Flat 2D cartoon character sprite, a single character centred on a fully
> transparent background. Bold uniform outline in deep navy `#12303C` at
> roughly 5% of the image width, with rounded corners and rounded line ends.
> Flat colour fills with exactly two extra tones per colour — one soft shade on
> the lower right, one pale highlight on the upper left — and no gradients
> across the whole character. Friendly, chunky, toy-like proportions: large
> head, small body, big simple eyes, short limbs. Standing upright, facing
> forward, full body visible including feet. Light source top-left. Crisp
> vector edges, no texture, no noise. Square 1024×1024; the character fills
> about 80% of the frame with even margins. No background, no ground plane, no
> cast shadow, no text, no watermark, no border, no second character.

## Negative prompt

> photorealistic, 3D render, anime, thin outlines, sketchy or uneven linework,
> drop shadow, background scenery, sky, grass, text, letters, numbers,
> watermark, logo, multiple characters, cropped or cut off at the frame edge,
> white background, grey background, checkerboard background, scary, gore,
> weapons pointed at the viewer

## Companions — twelve

Each one's dominant colour is fixed: it already tints that companion's tile in
the app, and a sprite that fights its tile will look wrong in the grid.

| Filename | Colour | Subject line |
|---|---|---|
| `char-mira.png` | turquoise `#05B1C9` | A small round owl with turquoise feathers, oversized amber eyes and a tiny cream lantern held in one wing, wings tucked in, standing on two small orange feet. |
| `char-ember.png` | orange `#F5A02B` | A plump orange salamander standing upright, a warm flame-shaped crest along its back, holding a small round cream shield with an orange rim. |
| `char-pilot.png` | green `#3E9E63` | A cheerful sage-green magpie standing upright, a small turquoise gem clutched to its chest, a cream flight cap with goggles pushed up on its head. |
| `char-quill.png` | violet `#6B4AA0` | A round violet hedgehog standing upright, blunt rounded quills, holding a single cream feather quill pen like a staff. |
| `char-cobalt.png` | deep blue `#3F63B5` | A small blue fox standing upright with a frost-tipped tail and pale ice-blue crystals along its shoulders, breath visible as a soft cream puff. |
| `char-marrow.png` | warm grey-brown `#8A7A4E` | A stout badger standing upright in a cream stonemason's apron, holding a small brass key with an oversized round bow. |
| `char-tessel.png` | teal `#2E9C86` | A small teal turtle standing upright, its shell drawn as neat repeating hexagon tiles in two teal tones, one flipper raised in a wave. |
| `char-nix.png` | ink `#12303C` | A sleek dark navy cat standing upright with bright turquoise eyes and a single cream sock on one front paw, tail curled beside it. |
| `char-fen.png` | sage green `#5E8C61` | A round sage-green frog standing upright wearing a small cream rain hood, one lily pad held like an umbrella above its head. |
| `char-slate.png` | stone grey `#7C8B93` | A small friendly stone golem standing upright, body built from three smooth rounded grey boulders, glowing turquoise cracks between them. |
| `char-vesper.png` | magenta `#B04A87` | A tiny magenta bat standing upright on small feet, wings folded like a cloak, one small gold star clasp at its throat. |
| `char-orrin.png` | ember red `#D9552F` | A sturdy young ram standing upright with short curled cream horns, a rust-red woollen scarf, front hooves planted confidently. |

## Bosses — six ranks

These are **rank-based, not place-based**: the same six appear across all ten
tracks of every course, with the track's own colour behind them. So they need
to escalate clearly against each other — a student should be able to tell rank
six from rank one at a glance and at thumbnail size.

Keep them **imposing but not frightening**. This is a study app used by
teenagers; the target is "a boss in a friendly platformer", not horror.

| Filename | Rank | Subject line |
|---|---|---|
| `boss-1-sentry.png` | 1 · Sentry | A small rounded guardian creature in pale violet stone, one large single turquoise eye, short stubby arms, standing alert. Simplest and smallest of the set. |
| `boss-2-warden.png` | 2 · Warden | A stocky violet guardian in a heavy cream collar, two glowing turquoise eyes, holding a short blunt staff with a round head, slightly larger and broader than the Sentry. |
| `boss-3-enforcer.png` | 3 · Enforcer | A broad armoured guardian in deep violet plate with cream trim, thick rounded shoulder pauldrons, arms crossed, a band of three turquoise lights across the chest. |
| `boss-4-champion.png` | 4 · Champion | A tall violet armoured figure with a rounded cream chest plate, a short cape in ember red, one fist raised, a single turquoise gem set in the brow. |
| `boss-5-vanguard.png` | 5 · Vanguard | An imposing violet guardian with two broad angular cream wings folded behind it, glowing turquoise seams down the arms, standing wide and squared. |
| `boss-6-overlord.png` | 6 · Overlord | The largest of the set: a towering deep violet guardian with a heavy crown of five blunt cream spikes, a wide ember-red mantle, four glowing turquoise eyes in a row, arms spread. |

## Where each is used

- **Companions** — the Characters grid (44pt tile, so they must read tiny) and
  the three-card preview on Profile.
- **Bosses** — the gate boss card at the foot of every open track, the crest on
  the stop sheet when a boss is tapped, and the boss stop nodes on the trail.

## Notes on getting a usable result

- **Do two first** — one companion and one boss — and check them together
  before generating the rest. Outline weight and eye size are what make a cast
  cohere, and both are far cheaper to fix in the style block once.
- **Reject cast shadows.** These sit on ground that changes colour per track;
  a baked grey shadow shows as a dirty smear.
- **Reject anything cropped at the frame edge.** The import pipeline trims to
  the object's own bounds and assumes nothing is clipped.
- **Check them at 44px.** A companion that only works large is no use in the
  roster grid. If the silhouette is unreadable when small, simplify it rather
  than shrinking the details.
