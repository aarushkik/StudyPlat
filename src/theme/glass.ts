/**
 * Liquid Glass tokens.
 *
 * Glass is for the layer that floats *over* content — the HUD, the tab bar,
 * the track banner, the floating button, sheets and dialogs — never for the
 * content itself. Cards on the map stay chunky and opaque; glass is how the
 * controls above them get out of the way.
 *
 * On iOS 26 the system draws the real material and none of this is used
 * except `thickNative`. Everywhere else (the web, older iOS) the material is
 * built from four layers, each with a token here:
 *
 * 1. A backdrop blur with boosted saturation, so colour from the map bleeds
 *    through instead of going grey.
 * 2. A translucent `tint` in the page's own hue — cream in light, deep teal in
 *    dark — strong enough to keep text legible over a busy map.
 * 3. A `sheen`: light pooling along the top, fading out by the middle.
 * 4. A `rim`: a one-point edge that is brightest on top and nearly gone at the
 *    bottom, the specular highlight that makes the surface read as a solid
 *    object rather than a blurred rectangle.
 *
 * `regular` is for bars and controls; `thick` for sheets and dialogs that
 * carry sentences, where legibility beats see-through.
