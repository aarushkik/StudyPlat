/**
 * What a student is worst at, from what they have actually answered.
 *
 * This replaced a hard-coded trio of AP Biology topics that every course
 * showed — a Calculus student was told to drill Photosynthesis. Accuracy is
 * now read from the real per-skill tally.
 *
 * Ranking is by a *smoothed* score rather than raw accuracy. Raw accuracy
 * makes one wrong answer out of one attempt a 0%, which would sit at the top
 * of the list forever on the strength of a single tap, above a topic genuinely
 * missed nine times out of ten. Adding one notional right and one notional
 * wrong answer to every tally (Laplace) pulls thin evidence towards the middle:
 * 0-from-1 scores 33% and 0-from-10 scores 8%, so the topic with real evidence
 * against it wins. The percentage *shown* is always the true one.
 *
 * An earlier version simply required three attempts before a skill could
 * appear, which meant the list stayed on its fallback for several sessions.
